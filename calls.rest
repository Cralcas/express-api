He is credited for transforming Sweden into a major European power and was one of the most successful military commanders of the Thirty Years' War. Under his leadership, Sweden became a military superpower and a model of early modern administrative efficiency. He was killed at the Battle of LÃ¼tzen in 1632, and is often referred to as 'The Lion of the North' and 'The Father of Modern Warfare'."
